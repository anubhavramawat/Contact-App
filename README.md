About the project -

The Contact App provides a seamless solution for users to organize and manage their contacts effectively, leveraging the power of React.js for dynamic frontend interactions and Firebase for reliable backend data storage.

It is a web application developed using React.js for the frontend library, HTML for markup, CSS and Bootstrap for styling, and Firebase for the backend to store contact information. The application allows users to view, store, and manage contact's information efficiently.

Key Features:

View Contacts: Users can view their list of contacts with details such as name, email, etc.

Add Contacts: Users can add new contacts by providing necessary information such as name, phone number, email, etc. The data is then stored securely in Firebase.

Search Functionality: The app provides a search feature to easily find specific contacts based on their name or other attributes.

Delete Contacts: Users can delete contacts they no longer need, with the option to confirm the action to prevent accidental deletions.

Error Handling and Validation: Proper error handling and validation are implemented throughout the application to provide a smooth user experience and prevent data inconsistencies.

Data Persistence: Contact data is stored securely in Firebase, ensuring data persistence and accessibility from any device with an internet connection.

User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their contacts efficiently.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
